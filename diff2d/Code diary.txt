Changed the PCG jacobi to have a preconditioner which is matrix free. Works in the
sequential case but having same problems with the parallel case.
For the parallel case there is a problem with the sparsegather function for both
pcg.f90 and jacobi.f90. Not sure what the fix will be.
First try altering the main driver and just using a broadcast command, similar to the
simple iterative.f90 drivers.
